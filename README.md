Some interesting data projects I have done were listed in this repo for imformation sharing purposes.

# Data Projects

## Data Science Projects

* [Machine Learning - Regressions](./Data_Science_Projects/Tradition_Data_Analytics/) A project to simply compare Linear Regression, ElasticNet Regression, Random Forest, Extra Trees, SVM, Gradient Boosted algorithms by using open source libraries, including pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, etc.
* [Time Series Analytics](./Data_Science_Projects/Time_Series_Forecasting) A project to compare time series algorithms, including Seasonal AutoRegression Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), AutoRegression Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Exponential Smoothing and Facebook Prophet by using open source pandas, numpy, fbprophet, statsmodel and scikit-learn libraries.
* [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](./Data_Science_Projects/NLP_Analysis_Spark/) A comparison project on NLP solutions including feature engineering with TFIDF, Hash TF, word2vec and classification with naive bayes, random forest, dense neural network by using open source pyspark and gensim libraries.
* [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](./Data_Science_Projects/NLP_Analysis_NNC) A NLP classification project by using word2vec and dense neural network technologies with pandas, sciki-learn and gensim open source libraries.
* [Natural Lanauage Processing (NLP) - Tensflow](./Data_Science_Projects/NLP_Analysis_Tensorflow/) A project to do NLP classification with convolutional neural network (CNN) by using open source tensorflow and kares libraries.
* [Personal Identifiable Information (PII) Detection](./Data_Science_Projects/PII_Detection/) A project to demonstrate how to use NLP pre-trained models (spaCy & presidio Python libraries) and AWS comprehend service to detect PII information.

## Data Engineering Projects

* [AWS Glue Jobs](./Data_Engineering_Projects/gluejobs) A project to create ETL processes by using AWS Glue jobs python scripts, including data schema validations, delta lake generation, glue shell job with pandas & numpy libraries.
* [AWS Kinesis Stream](./Data_Engineering_Projects/kinesis/) A project to create AWS Kinesis Stream processes to pull json data from randomuser.me with kinesis data streams, query data with kinesis analytics, save data into s3 with kinesis data firehose, and finally process data with a lambda function.
